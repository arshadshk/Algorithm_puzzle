This repo contains code for various Algorithm puzzle.

1.The Other Wolf-Goat-Cabbage Puzzle
You have 4n counters of four types: n wolfs, n goats, n cabbages, and
n hunters. The object is to place the counters in a row such that no one is in
danger; that is, no hunter is next to a wolf, no wolf is next to a goat, and no
goat is next to a cabbage. In addition, no two counters of the same kind may
be next to each other either. How many ways are there to solve the puzzle?

2. Lighter or Heavier?
You have n > 2 identical-looking coins and a two-pan balance scale with
no weights. One of the coins is a fake, but you do not know whether it is
lighter or heavier than the genuine coins, which all weigh the same. Design
an algorithm to determine in the minimum number of weighings whether
the fake coin is lighter or heavier than the others.

3.The Prince’s Tour
Consider a special chess piece—to be called here a “prince”–that can move
one square to the right, or one square downward, or one square diagonally
upward to the left. Find all values of n for which a prince can visit all the
squares of an n × n board exactly once on the same tour.
